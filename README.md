- **12:05:** Swung into action with a patch that’s more effective than a barrel of bananas.
- **12:07:** Testing the new version—because even monkeys double-check their banana splits!
- **1:33:** Build failed! (Oops, the jungle got a little wild.)

- **1:44:** Testing... (Keeping those bananas in line!)
