# 🐒 Gorilla Tag Standalone Mods – Monkey Business Fixed by Lane! 🐒

## UPDATES
In the wild jungle of updates, modding is now as tricky as teaching a banana to peel itself. But never fear—this cheeky chimp (a.k.a. Lane) is on the case!

## STATUS
- **12:02:** Spotted a pesky gremlin monkeying around in the code.
- **12:05:** Swung into action with a patch that’s more effective than a barrel of bananas.
- **12:07:** Testing the new version—because even monkeys double-check their banana splits!

Stay tuned for more monkey madness and keep on swinging!
